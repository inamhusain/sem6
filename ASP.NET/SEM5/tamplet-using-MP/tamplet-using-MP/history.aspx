                It all began in 1944 when Satish Chona, a young engineer working at BOAC (now British Airways), decided to set up a pop up ice cream shop in Karachi, Pakistan, called Havmor. What he started as a part-time venture to supplement the family income soon grew into a popular local ice cream brand. But the year 1947 proved to be a tumultuous one with the partition of India and Pakistan. Mr Chona and his family were forced to leave everything behind in Karachi as they migrated to India overnight in search of safety.

                 After attempting to set up a base in a couple of Indian cities including Dehradun and Indore, Mr Chona eventually decided to start his ice cream business in Ahmedabad. Here, the weather would stay warm for a better part of the year, which meant potentially higher ice cream sales. Mr Chona began Havmor operations with just 200 rupees from a humble handcart that he would take to the Ahmedabad railway station. Everyday, he would sell ice cream from his handcart that he and his wife, Mrs Nirmal Chona, painstakingly churned all night. To increase revenues, Mr Chona would borrow a friend’s cycle and sell ice cream around Ahmedabad while his friend would take care of the handcart.

                While Mr Chona worked tirelessly, it was his unwavering focus on 3 values – Acchai (Goodness), Sachhai (Truthfulness) and Safai (Cleanliness) – that helped him lay a solid foundation for the business. These 3 values still remain core to everything that is done at Havmor.
                Havmor’s range of products are today available across 14 markets in India with a network of restaurants, eateries and Havfunn parlours.

                Curating novelty of flavours since 70 years, 1944 is when our journey began. 1944 is part of the Havmor chain of restaurants, that started in Karachi before it moved to Ahmedabad, after the partition. Since the shift, there has been no looking back. Even today our food tops the consumer surveys for serving authentic North Indian Cuisine.
